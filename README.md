## Introduction

The website, product of the Frontend Developer Challenge from Linx Company, contains a
landing page that shows the list of products most preferred by users, and also features
that can help the users to interact with the site.

## Getting Started

You can use git clone to copy this repository by typing this command on your console:

```bash

```

or you can download the zip file and open it in your IDE/Computer.

Then you can open the html pages files normally in the folders, or you can utilize a server,

## Main Tools

<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>

## Features

<li>Listing of user's preferred products to checkout</li>
<li>User's form to help the algorithm be more accurate,
    that have an Arrow to close and open the section for small/medium devices.</li>
<li>Newsletter form to share the site</li>
<li>E-mail screen, to see how will appear to the user's e-mail.</li>

### Observations:

First: I didn't know if I was supposed to do the README in English or Portuguese,
so i did it in English :)

Second: I also didn't know if the Arrow in Section "Help improve the algorithm" in 
the Mobile Layout was really a drop down or not, so I implemented a feature to open 
and close the section according to the Arrow.
